推理小说家 Adam Carver新书付梓，邀请了一群推理小说爱好者在家中聚会，包括主人公 Alex Corby、Colin West、Vi Malik、Yva Dysart、Franny Smythe、Cornelia Crow，以及妻子 Victoria Carver、经纪人 Maria Bole、插画家 Quinn Shillerdyce。Alex 晚到，发现 Adam 死在密室中，钥匙在锁眼里，门从内侧贴上胶带。Alex 离开后不久返回，尸体消失。

有人把用胶带把房子正门自内封住。大家解开封印走入外面庭院，雪地完整无足迹，尽头处是一扇放下的铁栅栏门，门外吊桥升起。Maria 被杀，尸体双腕挂在升起的吊桥上，尸身夹在吊桥和铁栅栏门之间，一把利剑从铁栅栏门的格子中间穿过，刺入尸体肋部。旁边地上掉落一本书 <i>Hand at the Threshold</i>。看情形有人用胶带把剑固定在铁栅栏门上，然后操纵吊桥升起，将 Maria 推到剑尖之上。操纵吊桥和铁门的开关在庭院里的铁门控制室中。控制室的门闩上缠了胶带，上面放了一根蜡烛，显示有人来过，机关盒子上面也留下三支蜡烛，一根控制铁门的机关线被剪断。凶手拉起吊桥后如果留在户外，就不可能在房子大门内侧贴上胶带，但一旦回到房子里，则必将在雪地上留下足迹，所以这是一起不可能犯罪。

Alex told everyone Adam Carver is dead. Body and tape missing.
“With all the guests having chosen a room and retired to bed, Carver identified the one unoccupied room that Alex could select,” Yva continued.  “Letting himself in, he sealed the door shut from the inside with tape, turned the light out, and slumped against the far wall to wait.  And once Alex had eventually entered the room, seen his sham corpse, and fled, he immediately sprang into action – abandoning the ‘birthday present’, tearing the seal of tape free from the doorframe, and slipping away to his study or some other hideaway.  Once the coast was clear, he then got on with the business of setting up Maria’s murder whilst everyone else was asleep.  That having been committed, Carver is now either lurking somewhere in Carver’s Rest, waiting for an opportunity to commit his next atrocity, or has already parachuted down to a hidden motorboat at the foot of the cliffs to make his escape.” - Yva

“Inside the solarium, Franny was found hanged from the neck by a chain tethered to the arm of the late Mr. Carver, himself propped against the corridor door.  That door was sealed airtight with tape stuck over the cracks, applied from inside the room, and the already airtight balcony door was locked, which can also only be done from the inside; the balcony itself was covered in an unbroken layer of snow, with no snow having fallen since nightfall,” she recited.  “Also, the balcony key was found in Victoria’s pocket, put there while she was tied up in the armoury.”

Victoria's jewlery box was destructed. Checked earlier when looking for Adam.
Before the drawbridge was found to be up, the only people who could have broken that box were either Quinn Shillerdyce or CC Cornelia Crow
window key was missing
“Victoria had returned to the breakfast table, and within perhaps two minutes, Quinn had told them about the front door and they had all decamped in that direction.  If Quinn had met Cornelia coming down the stairs, he must have turned away from the group just as they were entering the lobby.  Add a few minutes for Quinn and Cornelia to talk while everyone else was discussing the state of the front door downstairs, and it all seemed to balance out.  Their window of opportunity to smash that box and go string-pulling was closing tight.”
The nine of us – Yva, Vi, Colin and Franny, and Cornelia, Quinn, Maria Bole and the two Carvers

“It was Victoria Carver, wrists and ankles bound and mouth covered with wide strips of tape, with something that looked very much like her own shawl wound around her head.” In the middle of the room. Still alive.

challenge to the reader
“Ten people, fans and professionals alike, gathered in this house to celebrate the success of Adam Carver’s Castles in the Sky tetralogy, and apparently to hear him announce a new book.  Adam Carver planned to stage a murder mystery as part of the event, centring around himself; but instead, something went wrong, and he was murdered for real, followed by his agent Maria Bole, the fanartist Colin West, and the reviewer Franny Smythe.”

“Alex, gasping, shoved the tall sheet of wood-panelling to one side, leaning it against the corner so it would not fall.  Behind her, the square passage that opened into the ensuite bathroom had one bare wall where the panelling had been removed.”
“the room Alex returned to was not, in fact, the same as the one she left”
“How did I know I’d come back to the same room?  I’d left the door open, my backpack in the doorway, and the light on,” Alex pointed out.  “But while nobody could have removed the tape and Adam Carver’s body in the minute I was away, they could open up the next door along, turn on the light, and move my bag across, and the gift-wrapped book, too – switching off this light and closing the door as they left.”
we thought it was Maria's room, but not

“And once there – it required only for Maria to be duped into turning her back for a second, and then a mace slipped from a museum exhibit and into a pocket knocked her to the ground in a trice.  Instantly, West drew forth a roll of tape, and stopped up her mouth so she could not scream when she awoke – and then, with the brute strength concealed within his heavy frame, he dragged her out onto the snowy drawbridge, to a point he had doubtless previously established by careful measurements.  He hurried away for a few seconds to retrieve a length of chain and a pair of padlocks from the tower storeroom – supplies he had previously determined existed, and likely prepared so as to be extracted within a moment – at which point he looped one end around Maria’s wrist and padlocked it tight, fed the chain through the anchors at the drawbridge’s upper corners, and then drew the remaining end to Maria’s other wrist and padlocked it tightly there too, ensuring the chain was pulled taut in a triangle such that Maria could not move and would be, when the drawbridge was raised, suspended in the ai”
“Leaving the broadsword momentarily in the gateway, he ran up the tower stairway to the controls, and lowered the portcullis.  Almost falling over himself in his haste, he plunged back down – and, with the portcullis fallen, he then hefted the great broadsword and passed its blade through one of the holes in the grating, doubtless preselected based on calculations performed on the previous days.  Pushed in to the hilt, which could not fit through, the weight of the blade held the sword in balance – making it a comparatively simple process, employing layers and layers of heavy-duty adhesive tape, to secure it in place.  The stage was set; all that was now required to execute Maria in the most gruesome fashion was to pull the lever that would cause the drawbridge to rise.”
“Maria’s murder was caused by a self-removing machine which left no evidence in the gatehouse – not a self-destroying machine which left no evidence at all”
“You wrap the book around with ribbon, leaving two very long loose ends.  Tie one end into a loose loop and hang it over the top of the drawbridge lever, balance the book on the opposite end of the portcullis shaft near the door, and hold it up with the remaining end of ribbon.  Then you slip out of the control room and bolt the gate, bringing your end of ribbon through the bars, and loop it around the bars and knot it to itself directly above the bolt.  Using a thick roll of tape, tape over the bolt again and again”
“all that tape doesn’t just keep the room locked up, it gives you a broad enough base to stick a candle on – you could even gouge a hole for it – and all the candles will have been those multi-hour candles, so you can predict exactly where the flame will be at a certain time.  You cut a notch in the candle at that point, pass the ribbon loop through it to touch the wick, and when the wick has reached that level then the ribbon will burn – and snap.”
Alex resumed for the finishing touches.  “The book’s support fails and it falls down the shaft, which puts its weight on the ribbon around the lever and pulls that down, and once it’s down then the last loop pulls off the lever and the whole thing falls to the bottom of the portcullis – where we found it,” she concluded.  “And meanwhile, the drawbridge is rising, bringing Maria towards the point of the sword…”

“Colin left through the balcony door,” she said, “but he didn’t have to step onto the balcony itself.  He put his feet on the railing.”
snow covered balcony
“Though more likely Colin used ribbon, since he evidently had reels of the stuff.  He would have threaded the key onto a length a bit longer than twice that of the room, with the key hanging from the middle and both ribbon-ends ultimately passing under the corridor door. On their way, one end could be twisted around a window handle, under the gym equipment, and finally under the door, to create a lever system which would turn the key when pulled; the other end of the ribbon would instead lead straight out from the key before being wound around a bar or some such and then again under the door.  When Colin got back to the corridor door, the two ends of ribbon were waiting for him; he held both, pulled one to turn the key and lock the balcony, and he pulled the other to pull the key out of the balcony door altogether, hauling the whole arrangement of key and ribbon out under the corridor door to join him. At that point, the other balcony doors on the floor could be locked for good measure, and that left us with the locked room as we discovered it – with the exception of the untaped gap under the door.  At that point, Colin only needed a way of folding down that last strip of tape so that it would stick against the floor, sealing the room entirely.”
“Colin ran a length of tape across the bottom of the door, wide enough that if pressed down it would stick to the floor, but folded upwards to leave the gap open.  After that, he pressed a piece of ribbon across the entire length of the tape, with some extra at one end, and slipped that under the door with the ribbon-ends from the key (he could have just used one of those, if he was careful).  Once on the other side of the door and with the balcony key retrieved, all that remained was to pull that additional ribbon to draw down the edge of the tape against the floor, with the rest of the strip following as the ribbon slowly unpeeled its way along.  By the time the ribbon pulled entirely free, the final strip of tape would have stuck across the entire gap, even a little tucked in as if somebody had pushed it with their fingers from the inside – but really, it was pulled in from the outside.”
“Colin had set up the iron maiden like this before he stabbed and bound himself.  Then he shuffled his way inside... and because his hands were taped in front of him, he could reach forwards and pull the door shut.”
