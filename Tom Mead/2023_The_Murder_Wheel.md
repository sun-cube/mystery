律师兼业余魔术师 Edmund Ibbs 邮购了一本魔术揭秘书 <i>The Master of Manipulation</i>，作者为 Dr. Anne L. Surazal，是 Lazarus Lennard 的倒写。Ibbs 去监狱采访“摩天轮杀人案”的嫌疑人 Carla Dean。Carla 和丈夫 Dominic Dean 一起坐摩天轮，路上疑似被一个跛足男人跟踪。在摩天轮上到顶部之时，Carla 突然听到一声枪响，随即见到 Dominic 痛苦地捂住腹部。Carla 捡起掉落的枪，在上面留下了指纹。Carla 坚称自己无辜，还说丈夫可能是因为害怕跛足男人所以带枪防身。

Ibbs 询问了摩天轮售票员 Miklos Varga 和证实 Dean 死亡的医生 Hugh Ransome，二人都证实见到跛足男人。Dean 的老板 Felix Draven 说 Dean 在死亡前夕心神不宁，因为他们供职的银行刚刚遭遇抢劫，Dean 安排值班的守卫 Arthur Morrison 被劫犯殴打至死。收银员 Cash 说在 Dean 死后有一人 Boyd Remiston 来问了许多问题。

Flint 警长认为臭名昭著的黑老大 Titus Pilgrim 与银行劫案相关，因为他曾策划好几起类似的劫案。Ibbs 怀疑 Dominic Dean 和 Pilgrim 里应外合，后被 Pilgrim 灭口。Ibbs 向魔术师侦探 Joseph Spector 寻求帮助。

# summary_en 038
Winchester hesitated before admitting, "Yeah, I guess you could say that. I told him to watch his mouth and back off. But I didn't touch him, I swear."

Flint raised an eyebrow, clearly skeptical. "Is that so? And what happened next?"

Winchester sighed. "Well, I turned to leave, but then I saw Martha talking to that dead man, the one in the crate. I didn't hear what they were saying, but she seemed upset. I didn't want to interrupt, so I just stayed back and watched. Then suddenly, she screamed and ran off stage. I don't know what happened after that."

Spector pressed further, "And you're sure you've never seen this dead man before?"

"I swear to you, I had never seen him before tonight. And I have no idea how he ended up in the crate."

Flint and Spector exchanged a glance, realizing that the mystery had deepened.
