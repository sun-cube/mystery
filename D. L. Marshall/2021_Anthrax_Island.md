主人公技工 John Taylor 上岛修理防污染的隔门，发现保险丝消失。岛上飘浮着致命的炭疽孢子，必须穿B级防护服。前任技工 Andy Kyle 在岛上暴毙，John 在其膝盖上发现伤痕。John 在焚烧炉里发现 Kyle 的茶罐，忽然有人从外面把焚烧炉锁上试图将其烧死，所幸 John 及时阻断了点火器逃生。John 请 Ingrid 测试土壤样本是否遭受污染，Ingrid 测出新品种病毒，认为与 Kyle 的死相关。John 判断 Kyle 是被人谋杀。

John 偷偷摸进工头 Greenbow 的办公室，发现钥匙串上少了两把开窗户的钥匙。John 猜测有人偷了钥匙从外面开窗，把含有炭疽的土壤样本撒入 Kyle 的房间，致其死亡，整个过程没有被内部的闭路电视拍到。为防万一 John 把窗户螺栓拧死。

众人听到 Viktor Demeter 与 Eric Gambetta 在发报室发生剧烈争执。Hurley、John 听到枪响，闯入发报室发现 Gambetta 中弹身亡，屋里的发报装置被毁坏，Demeter 不见踪迹。因为房间窗户锁死无法打开，所以这是一起密室杀人。Ingrid 亦中弹身亡，看情形 Demeter 先射杀 Ingrid，再回到基地射杀 Gambetta。发报室门口有一个暗门，通向地下的杂物间，里面发现 Demeter 的装备。Alice 在 Demeter 的书中发现敲诈字条，怀疑他是俄罗斯间谍。Donald Clay 在床上中毒身亡。

John 在 Hurley 的衣柜里发现一条裤子上有个四个洞，还在柜子的木板上发现一个洞。Gambetta 在实验室壁橱里藏了一把无声 PPK 手枪，枪套在其卧室床头柜中。Ingrid 的房间窗玻璃上有两个洞，因为手枪只开了一枪，所以开枪时窗户打开，凶手从窗户进屋。Demeter 有房门密码无需走窗户，说明 Demeter 不是凶手。闭路监视的内存卡消失不见。Demeter 的尸体在水管下方出现。Dash 曾向 Demeter 借钱。

岛上断电。John 布置了一个自动点火装置，一来电便会。John 被人开枪追杀，被迫跳崖逃生。John 开枪将 Greenbow 打伤。

Trapdoor near the door leading to the utility compartment under the floor. Found Demeter's gear. Tea sample for Ingrid to test. Sandwich bag. Melted usb stick. 
Alice found blackmail note in Viktor Demeter's book. Russian spy?
Dr Donald Clay was dead in bed. Could be the drink. 
Hurley wardrobe. Four holes in trouser. One hole in the solid wood base. 
Gun missing from Gambetta's room. 
Ingrid said sample contains unknown anthrax strain. Links to Andy Kyle. 
Ingrid room. Two bullet holes on window. Only one shot so the window was open. Demeter had the code to the door. Killer came in from window. Demeter was not the killer. 
CCTV stick was missing. 
Why Eric Gambetta had hidden his silenced Walther PPK on top of a cupboard here in this lab?
Holster was in Gambetta's bedroom drawer.

Dash had Demeter's watch on wrist. Actually Dash's watch. Dash owed Demeter money. 
Dirt in the generator. Power out. 
I set a fire device. If power is back on, murderer will need to run to radio room to save the sample vial. 
Dash accidentally cut his leg. 
Someone tried to shoot me. I jumped off cliff to escape. 
I'm a mercenary. 
I shot Greenbow in the leg because he pointed a gun at me. 
Hurley in the radio room trying to save vial. 
Gun fight. Hurley escaped from boat. I saved Marie. 
Gamebetta and Demeter didn't have alibi for killing Ingrid. 
I chased Hurley to village. Killed him. 
Marie took the other window key. Gave my gun to Hurley instead of killing him.  
Alice shot Gambetta. 

“Once inside the comms room, Gambetta went into overdrive, tearing off the red suit, throwing it and the gas mask under the floor. He took a lighter to the USB stick from the CCTV, because it would have shown that it was him, not Demeter, decontaminating. He smashed the radio, gave himself a couple of scratches and a bloody nose along the way, made it look like he’d been attacked.”
Tried to open window but failed. 
Hurley and Alice killed him. 
The gunshot we heard was from Hurley. Couldn't open window so fired into wardrobe. Head out of room shouting, creating alibi. 
We ran into radio room. Alice killed Gambetta with silenced pistol. Screamed to cover up sound.
